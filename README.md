# HR-Analytics-Dashboard

## A. Objective
The primary objective of the HR Analytics Dashboard project was to leverage Power BI and Power Query to analyze and visualize HR data comprehensively. The aim was to 
provide HR professionals with actionable insights into workforce dynamics, enabling data-driven decision-making and strategic planning.

## B. Problem Statement
In a rapidly evolving business landscape, traditional HR practices often lack the agility needed to respond to dynamic workforce challenges. The absence of a 
centralized analytics tool made it difficult for HR professionals to extract meaningful insights from scattered data sources. Key issues included difficulties 
in identifying performance trends, and optimizing workforce strategies.

## C. Tools
Primary: Power BI 
Secondary: Power Query

## D. Problem faced?
Data Inconsistency: One big issue we ran into during the HR Analytics Dashboard project was that our HR data was all over the place. Different systems and
databases meant the data had different formats, names, and overall quality problems. This made it tough to create a clear and accurate picture of our workforce.

Visualzation Techniques: Communicating the findings about employee attrition in a way that everyone in the HR team could understand was another hurdle. We needed to 
ensure that even those not well-versed in data could grasp the insights and contribute to informed decision-making.

## E. Solution
Data Cleaning: To deal with this inconsistence data, we turned to Power Query. This tool helped us bring together all our scattered HR datasets. With its data cleaning 
features, we could sort out inconsistencies and standardize the data. Power Query automated the cleaning process, making sure our final dataset was reliable, 
consistent, and without any mix-ups.

Visualzation: Our solution involved crafting a user-friendly interface within Power BI. The attrition insights were presented in clear and visually engaging dashboards,
making it easy for everyone to navigate and comprehend.

## F. Insights
This project illuminated the hidden dynamics of employee attrition, empowering our HR team to foresee and mitigate risks effectively. By harnessing the power of 
Power BI and predictive analytics, we gained valuable insights into attrition patterns, allowing us to shift from reactive to proactive workforce management. The 
user-friendly interface not only facilitated easy comprehension but also fostered a collaborative data-driven culture within the HR department. Overall, this experience 
emphasized the transformative impact that strategic data utilization can have on optimizing HR practices and enhancing employee retention strategies..
